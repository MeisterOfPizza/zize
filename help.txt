    -E, --extra-verbose                Print each file counted (there are many, will heavily decrease performance).
    -H, --help                         Print usage and options (this).
    -D, --large-dirs                   Show a list of the largest directories found.

    -F, --large-files                  Show a list of the largest files found.
    -M, --large-files-count=<count>    Show at least this many large files.
    -V, --verbose                      Print each directory counted (there are many, *may* decrease performance).
